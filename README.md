# Wordle

This Java application has the runs a word game called Wordle.
The aim is to guess a five-letter word in six attempts. Each box can hold one letter,
and so you guess at the correct word by typing in a five-letter word and hitting the Enter key.
To guide you towards the target word, each time you guess, certain letters will be highlighted. 
A letter coloured in yellow means that the letter is in the target word, but in the wrong 
position. A letter coloured in green indicates that it is a correct letter and also in the correct
position. Letters may be used twice or thrice in a word. If you fail 
to guess the target word in six tries, the answer will be revealed to you. 

The target audience of this application is any user who is looking for brain stimulating
entertainment, or simply those who desire a little more practice with their english vocabulary
and reasoning skills. As an avid word/puzzle game player, I find interest in exploring the technical
aspects that make such games possible.
